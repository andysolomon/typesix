    <blockquote>
      <p>In the sixteenth century, a series of common sizes developed among European typographers, and the series survived with little change 
      and few additions for 400 years. [...] Use the old familiar scale, or use new scales of your own devising, but limit yourself, at first,
      to a modest set of distinct and related intervals.<sup>[3]</sup></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p class="zeta pad--2 pad--lr">&ldquo;Typesix&rdquo; is a vertical grid system composed of three great resources. The first component
    of Typesix is the Robert Bringhurst Typographic scale as noted in his legendary book, <a href="#">&ldquo;The Elements of Typographic
    Style&rdquo;</a>.
    The second component is a six pixel <a href="http://www.teehanlax.com/blog/designing-faster-with-a-baseline-grid/">vertical grid</a> 
    system developed by Teehan Lax back in 2011. Last but not least, Typesix uses Pearsonifiedâ€™s Golden Ratio to get the correct amount of 
    characters per line (CPL) & appropriate line height for a readable paragraph.</p>

    <p class="pad--3">Most designers set their type arbitrarily, either by pulling values out of the sky or by adhering to a baseline 
    grid. The former case isn&rsquo;t worth discussing here, but the latter requires a closer <a href="">look</a>.</p>

    <p class="pad--3">Avoid using em tags when writing markup. The em tag adds an extra pixel to the line-height for reasons
    I'm not sure of. Try using an italic font-style, or use the true italic font-face of the desired typeface.</p>

      <p class="pad"><span class="zeta"><strong>Why 30?&nbsp;</strong></span><strong>30</strong> is the first number divisible by six immediately
      after <strong>24</strong>. According to the iOS Design Guidelines <strong>32px</strong>, is the optimal size for reading text on a mobile device. Consider
      this as a font-size for mobile experiences. Personaly I love using <strong>30px</strong> for H2&rsquo;s, and subheadings.</p>
      <p class="pad"><span class="zeta"><strong>Why 42?&nbsp;</strong></span><strong>42</strong> is chosen strictly has a line-height( a common
      theme when using Typesix ). Typesix sets its type based on two opionated ideals. The first is <strong>960px</strong> is the optimal width
      for viewing and reading on the web desktop. The second strong opinion is <strong>66</strong> characters is the ideal line-width for reading
      text. Using the golden ration calculator, I've found the ideal line-height for a <strong>30px</strong> font is actually <strong>43px</strong> tall. Since
      <strong>43</strong> is not divisible by 6 we round down to the nearest number divisible by six. which is our lucky number <strong>42</strong></p>
      <p class="pad"><span class="zeta"><strong>Why 96?&nbsp;</strong></span><strong>96</strong> similiar to <strong>42</strong> is introduced because it's
      the ideal font size for the largest number on the Bringust Scale <strong>72</strong>. Again using the same golden ratio rules as applied to
      <strong>42</strong>. <strong>96px</strong> is the optimial is the exact optimal line-height for <strong>72px</strong> font. We strive to achive a <strong>66</strong> character
      line width within a <strong>960px</strong> alloted space.</p>
      <p class="pad"><span class="zeta"><strong>Why 120?&nbsp;</strong></span><strong>120</strong> exceeds the Bringhust Scale and honestly is a
      number added strictly based upon the ideals of Typesix. 120px is largest type that I would typcally set on any website, and the
      number <strong>120</strong> is a number than can be be divided into many pieces. <br/> Ultimately this means that <strong>120</strong> can be cut into
      <mark>&frac12;,  &frac13;,  &frac14;, &frac15;, &frac16;, &frac18;</mark>.
      By the way, all of the numbers added to Bringhust Scale for Typesix can easily be divided by <strong>4</strong>, which
      gives us the ability to add padding and margin based on fractions of the font-size. To learn more about padding and margin as related to
      Typesix and typography in general please take a look at <a href="#">MovePad</a>.</p>

    <p class="pad--3 green-bg">Typesix doesn&rsquo;t give a fuck how you set your global border-box because all padding will based upon
    font size, just ensure that all of your padding declarations conform to a number that is divisible by 3.
    Using the <mark class="pad--quart">.pad</mark> class you'll have a standard padding of 1em set. To learn more about padding and margin
